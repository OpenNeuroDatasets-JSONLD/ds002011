    "Title": Neuromelanin-sensitive weighted images
    "Description": "These are fast spin echo sequences that help delineate the locus coeruleus. This sequence is sensitive to neuromelanin signal, a chemical stored in LC neurons, thereby creating a higher contrast-to-noise ratio between LC and neighboring tissue.",
